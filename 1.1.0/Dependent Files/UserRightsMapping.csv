SecEditName,FriendlyUserRightName,Description
SeTrustedCredManAccessPrivilege,Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller,The Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller policy setting is used by Credential Manager during backup and restore. No accounts should have this privilege because it is assigned only to the Winlogon service. Saved credentials of users may be compromised if this privilege is given to other entities.
SeNetworkLogonRight,Access this Computer from the Network,Determines which users are allowed to connect over the network to the computer.
SeTcbPrivilege,Act as part of the operating system,"The Act as part of the operating system policy setting determines whether a process can assume the identity of any user and thereby gain access to the resources that the user is authorized to access. Typically, only low-level authentication services require this user right. Potential access is not limited to what is associated with the user by default. The calling process may request that arbitrary additional privileges be added to the access token. The calling process may also build an access token that does not provide a primary identity for auditing in the system event logs. "
SeMachineAccountPrivilege,Add workstations to domain,"This policy setting determines which users can add a device to a specific domain. For it to take effect, it must be assigned so that it applies to at least one domain controller. A user who is assigned this user right can add up to ten workstations to the domain. Adding a machine account to the domain allows the device to participate in Active Directory-based networking."
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege,Adjust memory quotas for a process,This privilege determines who can change the maximum memory that can be consumed by a process. This privilege is useful for system tuning on a group or user basis.
SeInteractiveLogonRight,Allow log on locally,This policy setting determines which users can start an interactive session on the device. Users must have this user right to log on over a Remote Desktop Services session that is running on a Windows-based member device or domain controller.
SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight,Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services,This policy setting determines which users or groups can access the logon screen of a remote computer through a Remote Desktop Services connection. It is possible for a user to establish a Remote Desktop Services connection to a particular server but not be able to log on to the console of that same server.
SeBackupPrivilege,Backup files and directories,Allows the user to circumvent file and directory permissions to backup the system. The privilege is selected only when the application attempts to access through the NTFS backup application interface. Otherwise normal file and directory permissions apply.
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege,Bypass traverse checking,Allows the user to pass through folders to which the user otherwise has no access while navigating an object path in any Microsoft Windows file system or in the Registry. This privilege does not allow the user to list the contents of a folder; it allows the user only to traverse its directories.
SeSystemtimePrivilege,Change the system time,Allows the user to set the time for the internal clock of the computer.
SeTimeZonePrivilege,Change the time zone,"This policy setting determines which users can adjust the time zone that is used by the computer for displaying the local time, which includes the computer's system time plus the time zone offset."
SeCreatePagefilePrivilege,Create a pagefile,Allows the user to create and change the size of a pagefile.
SeCreateTokenPrivilege,Create a token object,"This policy setting determines which accounts a process can use to create a token, and which accounts it can then use to gain access to local resources when the process uses NtCreateToken() or other token-creation APIs."
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege,Create global objects,This policy setting determines which users can create global objects that are available to all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not have this user right.
SeCreatePermanentPrivilege,Create permanent shared objects,"This user right determines which accounts can be used by processes to create a directory object by using the object manager. Directory objects include Active Directory objects, files and folders, printers, registry keys, processes, and threads. Users who have this capability can create permanent shared objects, including devices, semaphores, and mutexes. This user right is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the object namespace. Because components that are running in kernel-mode inherently have this user right assigned to them, it is not necessary to specifically assign it."
SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege,Create symbolic links,This user right determines if users can create a symbolic link from the computer they are logged on to.
SeDebugPrivilege,Debug programs,Allows the user to attach a debugger to any process.
SeDenyNetworkLogonRight,Deny Access to this computer from the network,Prohibits a user or group from connecting to the computer from the network.
SeDenyBatchLogonRight,Deny log on as a batch job,This policy setting determines which accounts are prevented from logging on by using a batch-queue tool to schedule and start jobs automatically in the future. The ability to log on by using a batch-queue tool is needed for any account that is used to start scheduled jobs by means of the Task Scheduler.
SeDenyServiceLogonRight,Deny log on as a service,This policy setting determines which users are prevented from logging on to the service applications on a device.
SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight,Deny local logon,Prohibits a user or group from logging on locally at the keyboard.
SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight,Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services,"This policy setting determines which users are prevented from logging on to the device through a Remote Desktop connection through Remote Desktop Services. It is possible for a user to establish a Remote Desktop connection to a particular server, but not be able to log on to the console of that server."
SeEnableDelegationPrivilege,Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation,"This policy setting determines which users can set the Trusted for Delegation setting on a user or computer object. Security account delegation provides the ability to connect to multiple servers, and each server change retains the authentication credentials of the original client. Delegation of authentication is a capability that client and server applications use when they have multiple tiers. It allows a public-facing service to use client credentials to authenticate to an application or database service. For this configuration to be possible, the client and the server must run under accounts that are trusted for delegation."
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege,Force shutdown from a remote system,Allows a user to shut down a computer from a remote location on the network.
SeAuditPrivilege,Generate security audits,Allows a process to generate entries in the security log. The security log is used to trace unauthorized system access and other security relevant activities.
SeImpersonatePrivilege,Impersonate a client after authentication,"This policy setting determines which programs are allowed to impersonate a user or another specified account and act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this type of impersonation, an unauthorized user cannot cause a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created to impersonate that client. (Such an action could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.)"
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege,Increase a process working set,"This policy setting determines which users can increase or decrease the size of the working set of a process. The working set of a process is the set of memory pages currently visible to the process in physical RAM. These pages are resident, and they are available for an application to use without triggering a page fault. The minimum and maximum working set sizes affect the virtual memory paging behavior of a process."
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege,Increase quotas,"Allows a process that has Write Property access to another process to increase the processor quota that is assigned to the other process. This privilege is useful for system tuning, but it can be abused, as in a denial of service attack."
SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege,Increase scheduling priority,Allows a process that has Write Property access to another process to increase the execution priority of the other process.
SeLoadDriverPrivilege,Load and unload device drivers,Allows a user to install and uninstall Plug and Play device drivers. This privilege does not apply to device drivers that are not Plug and Play; only Administrators can install these device drivers. Note that device drivers run as Trusted (highly privileged) processes; a user can abuse this privilege by installing hostile programs and giving them destructive access to resources.
SeLockMemoryPrivilege,Lock pages in memory,"This policy setting determines which accounts can use a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the computer from paging the data to virtual memory on a disk."
SeBatchLogonRight,Log on as a batch job,Allows a user to log on by using a batch-queue facility.
SeInteractiveLogonRight,Log on locally,Allows a user to log on locally at the computers keyboard.
SeServiceLogonRight,Logon as a service,"Allows a security principal to log on as a service. Services can be configured to run under the LocalSystem account, which has a built-in right to log on as a service. Any service that runs under a separate account must be assigned the right."
SeSecurityPrivilege,Manage auditing and security log,"Allows a user to specify object access auditing options for individual resources such as files, Active Directory objects, and Registry keys. Object access auditing is not actually performed unless it has been enabled it in Audit Policy. A user who has this privilege also can view and clear the security log from event viewer."
SeRelabelPrivilege,Modify an object label,"This privilege determines which user accounts can modify the integrity label of objects, such as files, registry keys, or processes owned by other users. Processes running under a user account can modify the label of an object owned by that user to a lower level without this privilege."
SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege,Modify firmware environment values,Allows modification of system environment variables either by a process through an API or by a user through the System Properties applet.
SeManageVolumePrivilege,Perform volume maintenance tasks,"This policy setting determines which users can perform volume or disk management tasks, such as defragmenting an existing volume, creating or removing volumes, and running the Disk Cleanup tool."
SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege,Profile a single process,Allows a user to run Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000 performance monitoring tools to monitor the performance of nonsystem processes.
SeSystemProfilePrivilege,Profile system performance,Allows a user to run Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000 performance monitoring tools to monitor the performance of system processes.
SeUndockPrivilege,Remove computer from docking station,Allows a user of a portable computer to unlock the computer by clicking Eject PC on the Start menu.
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege,Replace a process-level token,Allows a parent process to replace the access token that is associated with a child process.
SeRestorePrivilege,Restore files and directories,Allows a user to circumvent file and directory permissions when restoring backed-up files and directories and to set any valid security principal as the owner of an object.
SeShutdownPrivilege,Shut down the system,Allows a user to shut down the local computer.
SeSyncAgentPrivilege,Synchronize directory service data,"This policy setting determines which users and groups have authority to synchronize all directory service data, regardless of the protection for objects and properties. This privilege is required to use LDAP directory synchronization (dirsync) services. Domain controllers have this user right inherently because the synchronization process runs in the context of the System account on domain controllers."
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege,Take ownership of files or other objects,"Allows the user to take ownership of any securable object in the system, including Active Directory objects, files and folders, printers, Registry keys, processes, and threads."
